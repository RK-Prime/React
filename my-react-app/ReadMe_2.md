Hello There !!

The components created are located inside the utils folder of the src folder present in the my-react-app, 

and the functions associated and used for the making of the project, are declared inside the function.js folder,

the function.js mainly consists only an example MockData to be used inside the swiggy clone, not necessarily but only for practise.
