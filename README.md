The folder my-react-app contains the Swiggy Clone Front End, which is under process.

The folder swiggy clone siteplan is just a simple siteplan created for the making of Front End of Swiggy Clone Home page.

The folders Videos and live recording contains the practise codes, I created while learning the concepts of react.


The folder my-app is just a mistaken folder but will be creating some thing interesting in the same.
